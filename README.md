Carousel
========

There are a million scripts out there for creating a carousel on we website. Why write another one?

(1) I want a carousel that is truly responsive.

(2) I want a carousel that doesn't come with it's own stylesheet. I want to create my own style.

(3) I want a carousel to handle more than just images.

(4) I want a carousel that will work with my HTML's class and id attributes.

(5) I want a carousel that uses a simple, easy to understand JavaScript.

If you want the same things, then you might find this script useful.
